;       This program is designed to illustrate simple 80x86
;       instructions : (i.e. that access registers).
;
;       Note to student  :  The comments in the following program
;                           are designed to assist you understand
;                           the program.  However, you should avoid
;                           such simplifications when you write
;                           comments in your programs.  Therefore,
;                           when you write comments for programs :
;                            ---- the comments should explain the logic
;                                 of a block of instructions, rather
;                                 than explaining the instructions.
